# Neural-network---make-moons-with-1000-samples
This script implements a small fully-connected neural network from scratch using NumPy to classify the make_moons toy dataset. It trains the network with mini-batch SGD and demonstrates/compares two hidden-layer activation choices (sigmoid vs ReLU). The script also visualizes the decision boundary and plots loss/accuracy per epoch.
